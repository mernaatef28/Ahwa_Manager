- **Add Menu Items**: Create new items with details like name, category, price, and image.
- **Update Menu Items**: Modify existing items (e.g., price, category, or image).
- **Delete Menu Items**: Remove menu items from the list.
- **View Menu**: Display a list of all menu items, with the option to filter by category (e.g., drinks, snacks).
- **Search/Filter**: Find specific items based on criteria (e.g., price range or category).

### 2. Order Management
- **Track Orders**: View and manage orders with statuses (e.g., "pending", "complete").
- **Order Display**: The manager can see a list of all orders, with filtering options:
  - **Pending Orders**: Orders that are placed but not yet processed.
  - **Complete Orders**: Orders that have been fulfilled and delivered.
- **Order Status Update**: The manager can update the status of orders (e.g., from pending to complete).

### 3. Reporting

## SOLID & OOP Principles Used

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class and module has one job, e.g., `MenuItem` is for item data, `MenuService` handles business logic, `MenuRepository` manages data access, and `OrderService` manages order workflows.
- **Open/Closed**: The system is open for extension (e.g., adding new features like reporting or changing data storage) but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Different implementations of repositories (e.g., in-memory or database) can be swapped without breaking functionality.
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces like `MenuRepository` focus solely on menu-related operations, and `OrderRepository` does the same for order-related operations.
- **Dependency Inversion**: The app depends on abstractions like `MenuService`, `OrderService`, and `MenuRepository`, making it flexible and testable.

## Conclusion
